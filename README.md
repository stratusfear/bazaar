Bazaar is a new app store for GNOME with a focus on discovering and installing
applications and add-ons from Flatpak remotes, particularly
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/). It emphasizes supporting the developers who
make the Linux desktop possible. Bazaar features a "curated" tab that can be
configured by distributors to allow for a more localized experience.

Bazaar is fast and highly multi-threaded, guaranteeing a smooth
experience in the user interface. You can queue as many downloads as
you wish and run them while perusing Flathub's latest releases.
This is due to the UI being completely decoupled from all backend operations.

It runs as a service, meaning state will be maintained even if you
close all windows, and implements the gnome-shell search provider dbus
interface. A krunner
[plugin](https://github.com/ublue-os/krunner-bazaar) is available for
use on the KDE Plasma desktop.

Thanks to [Jakub Steiner](http://jimmac.eu) for designing Bazaar's
icon.

### Installing

Pre-built binaries are distributed via Flathub and GitHub actions:

### Contributing

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a distributor/packager who would like to learn how to
customize Bazaar, take a look at the [docs](/docs/overview.org).

If you would like to try this project on your local machine, clone it
on the cli and type these commands inside the project root:

```sh
meson setup build --prefix=/usr/local
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
